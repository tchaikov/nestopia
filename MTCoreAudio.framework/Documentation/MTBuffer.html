<h1>MTBuffer</h1>
<p>
<strong>MTBuffer</strong> is an abstract class that implements a <a href="#disc-generalized">generalized</a>,
<a href="#disc-thread-safe">thread-safe</a>,
<a href="#disc-flow-controlled">flow-controlled, fixed-size buffer</a>.

<h2>Discussion</h2>
<p>
<a name="disc-generalized"></a>
MTBuffer is intended to be subclassed to store and retrieve actual data.  MTBuffer is based on the notion of an <i>abstract frame</i>,
which may be a byte, or an arbitrary number of simultaneous, de-interleaved audio samples, or in fact anything that can be sequential.
An MTBuffer is structured as a finite ring of abstract frames.  The nature of the ring is hidden from the outside; it is
an implementation detail.  Wrap-around at the end of the ring is handled by MTBuffer; most subclasses will be able to
ignore this.

<p>
<a name="disc-thread-safe"></a>
Multiple threads may read and write on an MTBuffer simultaneously.  Their operations will be coordinated and consistent, unless the MTBuffer is
<a href="#configureForSingleThreadedOperation">configured for single-threaded operation</a>.  A single-threaded MTBuffer is intended to be used
in one thread only, or protected with external synchronization.  Single-threaded mode is an optimization to avoid taking
and releasing locks unnecessarily.  Note that flow control is disabled in this mode; that is, read and write operations
behave in the non-waiting manner.

<p>
<a name="disc-flow-controlled"></a>
An MTBuffer can hold up to a fixed number of abstract frames simultaneously.  However, when using waiting operations,
an arbitrary number of abstract frames may flow from a writer thread to a reader thread in a single method invocation.
When writing frames, if the buffer fills to capacity, it can either wait for room to become available by another thread
reading, or just do as much as it can immediately.  Unread data in the buffer will not be overwritten.  Likewise,
when reading frames, if the buffer becomes empty, it can either wait for more data to be written, or just
do as much as it can immediately with data on hand.  Reading and writing operations signal each other to
convey the availability, or lack thereof, of data and free space.

<h4>Subclassing Guidelines</h4>
<p>
A subclass should provide its designated initializer to initialize its actual buffer and any other data
needed.  It should invoke <code>[super <a href="#initWithCapacity:">initWithCapacity:</a>]</code>.  A subclass
must provide concrete methods specific to its nature for reading and writing.  These methods will create
a context block, specific to the subclass and opaque to MTBuffer, that will be passed by way of MTBuffer's
<a href="#readToContext:count:waitForData:">readToContext:count:waitForData:</a>
and
<a href="#writeFromContext:count:waitForRoom:">writeFromContext:count:waitForRoom:</a>
to the subclass's
<a href="#performReadToContext:offset:count:">performReadToContext:offset:count:</a>
and
<a href="#performWriteFromContext:offset:count:">performWriteFromContext:offset:count:</a>
methods.  These methods implement the
actual data copying between user data and the concrete buffer.

<p>
See the implementation of <a href="MTByteBuffer.html">MTByteBuffer</a> for an example of a concrete
subclass of MTBuffer.

<h2>Instance Methods</h2>
<hr>

<h3><a name="bufferDidEmpty">bufferDidEmpty</a></h3>
<code>- (void) bufferDidEmpty</code>
<br><br>
You should never send this message directly.
Method to be implemented by subclasses, to perform any needed housekeeping or any other function.
This message is sent when a read operation leaves the buffer empty.
This message is sent while the buffer is is locked, so care should be taken
not to perform non-real-time-safe operations if the buffer may be used
with real-time constraints.  The default implementation does nothing.
<br><br>
<hr width="25%" align=left>

<h3><a name="capacity">capacity</a></h3>
<code>- (unsigned) capacity</code>
<br><br>
Returns the capacity of the receiver in abstract frames.
<br><br>
<hr width="25%" align=left>

<h3><a name="close">close</a></h3>
<code>- (void) close</code>
<br><br>
Indicates to the receiver that no more abstract frames will be written into the buffer.  This causes reading and writing operations to
behave in the non-waiting manner, even if waiting is requested.  Operations in progress and waiting for data or room
will complete with whatever they were able to accomplish up to that point.  Further writes will not succeed.  Any
abstract frames remaining in the receiver may be read out.
<br><br>
<hr width="25%" align=left>

<h3><a name="configureForSingleThreadedOperation">configureForSingleThreadedOperation</a></h3>
<code>- (void) configureForSingleThreadedOperation</code>
<br><br>
Disables the receiver's synchronization interlocks and causes reading and writing operations to behave
in the non-waiting manner, even if waiting is requested.
<br><br>
<hr width="25%" align=left>

<h3><a name="count">count</a></h3>
<code>- (unsigned) count</code>
<br><br>
Returns the number of abstract frames currently stored in the receiver.
<br><br>
<hr width="25%" align=left>

<h3><a name="flush">flush</a></h3>
<code>- (void) flush</code>
<br><br>
Empties the receiver.  Sends <a href="#bufferDidEmpty">bufferDidEmpty</a> to the receiver.
<br><br>
<hr width="25%" align=left>

<h3><a name="initWithCapacity:">initWithCapacity:</a></h3>
<code>- (id) initWithCapacity:(unsigned)capacity</code>
<br><br>
Initializes a newly allocated buffer with space for <i>capacity</i> abstract frames.  This is the designated initializer.
<br><br>
<hr width="25%" align=left>

<h3><a name="isClosed">isClosed</a></h3>
<code>- (Boolean) isClosed</code>
<br><br>
Returns <code>YES</code> if <a href="#close">close</a> has been sent to the receiver, and <code>NO</code> otherwise.
<br><br>
<hr width="25%" align=left>

<h3><a name="performReadToContext:offset:count:">performReadToContext:offset:count:</a></h3>
<code>- (void) performReadToContext:(void *)theContext offset:(unsigned)theOffset count:(unsigned)count</code>
<br><br>
You should never send this message directly.  Subclasses <strong>must</strong> override
this method to implement the actual data copying appropriate for that class.
This message is sent to the receiver by
<a href="#readToContext:count:waitForData:">readToContext:count:waitForData:</a>
one or more times to copy <i>count</i> sequential abstract frames from the
receiver's buffer, starting at abstract frame <i>theOffset</i>,
to the current position in <i>theContext</i>.
The implementation is responsible for advancing the current position in <i>theContext</i>
by <i>count</i> abstract frames in the appropriate manner.
<i>theOffset</i> plus <i>count</i> will not exceed the
<a href="#capacity">capacity</a> of the buffer, nor
<a href="#count">count</a>.
The default implementation of this method does nothing.
<br><br>
<hr width="25%" align=left>

<h3><a name="performWriteFromContext:offset:count:">performWriteFromContext:offset:count:</a></h3>
<code>- (void) performWriteFromContext:(void *)theContext offset:(unsigned)theOffset count:(unsigned)count</code>
<br><br>
You should never send this message directly.  Subclasses <strong>must</strong> override
this method to implement the actual data copying appropriate for that class.
This message is sent to the receiver by
<a href="#writeFromContext:count:waitForRoom:">writeFromContext:count:waitForRoom:</a>
one or more times to copy <i>count</i> sequential abstract frames from the
current position in <i>theContext</i>
into the receiver's buffer, starting at abstract frame <i>theOffset</i> of the receiver's
buffer.
The implementation is responsible for advancing the current position in <i>theContext</i>
by <i>count</i> abstract frames in the appropriate manner.
<i>theOffset</i> plus <i>count</i> will not exceed the
<a href="#capacity">capacity</a> of the buffer, nor the amount of room remaining.
The default implementation of this method does nothing.
<br><br>
<hr width="25%" align=left>

<h3><a name="readToContext:count:waitForData:">readToContext:count:waitForData:</a></h3>
<code>- (unsigned) readToContext:(void *)theContext count:(unsigned)count waitForData:(Boolean)wait</code>
<br><br>
You should never send this message directly.  Subclasses will send this message to <i>self</i>
to cause <i>count</i> abstract frames to be copied from the receiver's buffer into
<i>theContext</i> by sending
<a href="#performReadToContext:offset:count:">performReadToContext:offset:count:</a>
to the receiver as many times as necessary.  If <i>wait</i> is <code>NO</code>, then
a maximum of <a href="#count">[receiver count]</a> frames will be copied into <i>theContext</i>.
If <i>wait</i> is <code>YES</code> and the receiver has not been
<a href="#close">closed</a>, then all of the requested frames will be copied, pausing
as necessary for frames from
<a href="#writeFromContext:count:waitForRoom:">writeFromContext:count:waitForRoom:</a>s
to be added to the buffer.  May cause
<a href="#bufferDidEmpty">bufferDidEmpty</a>
to be sent to the receiver one or more times, if the buffer becomes empty,
is refilled, empties again, etc. while this method is processed.
Returns the number of frames copied.
<br><br>
<hr width="25%" align=left>

<h3><a name="writeFromContext:count:waitForRoom:">writeFromContext:count:waitForRoom:</a></h3>
<code>- (unsigned) writeFromContext:(void *)theContext count:(unsigned)count waitForRoom:(Boolean)wait</code>
<br><br>
You should never send this message directly.  Subclasses will send this message to <i>self</i>
to cause <i>count</i> abstract frames to be copied from <i>theContext</i>
into the receiver's buffer by sending
<a href="#performWriteFromContext:offset:count:">performWriteFromContext:offset:count:</a>
to the receiver as many times as necessary.  If <i>wait</i> is <code>NO</code>, then
a maximum of the currently available space in the buffer will be copied from <i>theContext</i>.
If <i>wait</i> is <code>YES</code> and the receiver has not been
<a href="#close">closed</a>, then all of the requested frames will be copied, pausing
as necessary for space to become available by
<a href="#readToContext:count:waitForData:">readToContext:count:waitForData:</a>s
removing frames from the buffer.  Returns the number of frames copied.
