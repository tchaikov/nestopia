<h1>MTCoreAudio.framework</h1>
<p>
The <strong>MTCoreAudio</strong> framework is a
<a href="http://developer.apple.com/techpubs/macosx/Cocoa/CocoaTopics.html">Cocoa-flavored</a>
Objective-C wrapping around the
<a href="http://developer.apple.com/audio/pdf/coreaudio.pdf">
Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) of Apple's CoreAudio library</a>.
</p>

<p>
Download MTCoreAudio.framework, its source code, and
two example programs with source as either a
<a href="http://aldebaran.armory.com/~zenomt/macosx/MTCoreAudio/MTCoreAudio.dmg">disk image</a>
(and its <a href="http://aldebaran.armory.com/~zenomt/macosx/MTCoreAudio/MTCoreAudio.dmg-sig.txt">PGP signature</a>)
or a
<a href="http://aldebaran.armory.com/~zenomt/macosx/MTCoreAudio/MTCoreAudio.tgz">compressed tar file</a>
(and its <a href="http://aldebaran.armory.com/~zenomt/macosx/MTCoreAudio/MTCoreAudio.tgz-sig.txt">PGP signature</a>).

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
MTCoreAudio provides one main class, <strong>MTCoreAudioDevice</strong>,
which abstracts the global audio hardware environment and the individual
audio devices attached to the system.  The class includes methods for
finding the system's default input and output devices, all of the devices
attached to the system, or a particular device based on its unique
identifier (a persistent address which can identify an audio device
across reboots and reconfiguration).  The class can accomodate a delegate
for global hardware events.  Device instances accomodate a delegate for
device-specific events.
</p>

<p>
A device instance may have a single
AudioDeviceIOProc (a C function, the same as
with CoreAudio HAL), or a target/selector for the IO cycle.
Multiple device instances may refer to the same
physical device, and each instance may have its own AudioDeviceIOProc (or target/selector),
which may be different from, or the same as, other instances' AudioDeviceIOProcs (or targets/selectors).
Note that the earlier limitation
that the AudioDeviceIOProcs not be the same for instances referring
to the same physical device has been removed.
For example:
<pre>
	...
	MTCoreAudioDevice * theInputDevice = [MTCoreAudioDevice defaultInputDevice];
	MTCoreAudioDevice * theOutputDevice = [MTCoreAudioDevice defaultOutputDevice];
	MTCoreAudioDevice * theSysOutputDevice = [MTCoreAudioDevice defaultSystemOutputDevice];

	[theInputDevice setIOProc:myInputIOProc withClientData:self];
	[theOutputDevice setIOProc:myOutputIOProc withClientData:self];
	[theSysOutputDevice setIOProc:myOutputIOProc withClientData:other];
	...
</pre>
will work, even if the default input, output, and system output devices are the same
physical device.
</p>

<p>
An MTCoreAudioDevice instance lets you query and control most of
a device's properties, such as a channel's volume, mute, or play-through
settings, input or output sources (such as internal microphone, line in,
et cetera), buffer size, sample rate, channel configuration, and clock
sources.

<p>
In the CoreAudio HAL, devices consist of one or more audio <i>streams</i>,
which have an implicit direction (either record or playback).
<strong>MTCoreAudioStream</strong> encapsulates a stream.  An instance
of this class is always associated with an MTCoreAudioDevice instance.
Using MTCoreAudioStreams gives you most of the same controls over a
device's channels, and is convenient for dealing with audio devices in
your code in a manner more analogous to how the device is laid out.
MTCoreAudioStreams also provide the only means to modify the hardware
data format of the device (such as sample bit depth).  This is because,
in the HAL, a stream is the only way to modify those parameters.
MTCoreAudioStreams can accomodate a delegate for stream-related notification
events; however, if an instance does not have a delegate, the delegate
of the associated MTCoreAudioDevice instance will be used.
</p>

<p>
The <strong>MTCoreAudioStreamDescription</strong> class is just a simple
wrapper around the HAL's <i>AudioStreamBasicDescription</i>, which is
used for describing both the logical and physical data formats of
audio data in a device and its streams.  This structure is encapsulated
in an Objective-C class to simplify memory management
(especially when working with arrays of supported formats), and to
provide a simple text description of a format.
</p>

<p>
Some services of <strong>MTCoreAudio</strong> require initialization before use.
These include
<a href="MTCoreAudioDevice.html#notifications">hardware notifications</a> and
<a href="ValueTransformers.html">value transformers</a>.  These services are
initialized when you send the first message to class
<a href="MTCoreAudioDevice.html">MTCoreAudioDevice</a>.  This is usually
accomplished by sending
<code><a href="MTCoreAudioDevice.html#attachNotificationsToThisThread">+attachNotificationsToThisThread</a></code>
in your <code>main()</code> function, but may be accomplished by sending any message to
the class before attempting to use those services.
